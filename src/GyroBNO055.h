   * The GyroBNO055 class is used to configure and read information
   * from the Adafruit BNO055 absolute 9DOF sensor
   * (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2472).
   *
   * <p>This sensor provides directions about which way you are facing
   * and is one of the easiest and most stable gyros I have used.</p>
   * 
   * <p>This C++ implementation uses the BlackLib I2C classes for
   * communications and a lot of information from Adafruit's sampe
   * Arduino code at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055. For
   * full details on what the sensor is capable of, refer to the Bosh
   * datasheet
   * (http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf).</p>
   *
   * <p>Example usage:</p>
   *
   * <pre><code>
   * GyroBNO055 gyro;
   * 
   * gyro.reset();
   *
   * float ang;
   * if (gyro.getHeading(ang)) {
   *   cout << "Heading: " << ang << "\n";
   * } else {
   *   cout << "Gyro not responding\n";
   * }
   * </code></pre>
